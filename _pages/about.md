Hello everyone! Now I am in my third year as an undergraduate student studying in Fundan University, Shanghai, China, majoring in **Electronic Information Science and Technology**. I plan to persue a Ph.D degree in the future. 

In the past year, I participated in **FDUROP** program, which provides research opportunities for undergraduate students in FDU. Under the supervision of [Prof. Jie Ding](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085582813), my research has focused on target controllability of complex networks, which is an interdisciplinary area between control theory and network science and has a strong relationship with graph theory.

Now I am conducting summer research at the Royal Institute of Technology(KTH), under the superversion of [Prof. Qianwen Xu](https://www.kth.se/profile/qianwenx). My research mainly focuses on the local energy trading. I will develop a full-stack trading platform.

Meanwhile, I will write some research proposals or overviews on the following topics:
- Network science (mainly focus on dynamics)
- Reinforcement learning and optimal control
- Deep learning and optimization
- Smart grid
- Economics and game theory

You can see the documents in the [Research](https://xiaolehuu.github.io/research/).
